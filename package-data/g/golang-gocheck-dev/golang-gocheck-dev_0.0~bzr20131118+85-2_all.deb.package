Description: Richer testing framework for Go libraries and applications to use
 gocheck extends Go's internal testing library with features such as:
 .
    - Helpful error reporting to aid on figuring problems out
    - Richer test helpers: assertions which interrupt the test immediately,
      deep multi-type comparisons, string matching, etc
    - Suite-based grouping of tests
    - Fixtures: per suite and/or per test set up and tear down
    - Benchmarks integrated in the suite logic (with fixtures, etc)
    - Management of temporary directories
    - Panic-catching logic, with proper error reporting
    - Proper counting of successes, failures, panics, missed tests, skips, etc
    - Explicit test skipping
    - Support for expected failures
    - Verbosity flag which disables output caching (helpful to debug
      hanging tests, for instance)
    - Multi-line string reporting for more comprehensible failures
    - Inclusion of comments surrounding checks on failure reports
    - Fully tested (it manages to test itself reliably)
