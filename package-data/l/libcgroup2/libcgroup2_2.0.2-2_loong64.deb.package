Description: control and monitor control groups (library)
 Control Groups (cgroups) provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets
 of tasks, and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with
 specialized behaviour.
 .
 libcgroup allows one to manipulate, control, administrate and monitor cgroups
 and the associated controllers.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
